        <h1>Safety Steps</h1>
        <section>
            <h3>1. Electrical Safety:</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>When installing a smart toilet, it's crucial to ensure that all electrical components are set up correctly. This
                includes properly connecting wires, plugs, and any control panels.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the smart toilet installation complies with safety standards and local electrical codes to prevent
                electrical hazards.</li>
                <li>Keep water away from electrical connections and outlets to avoid the risk of electrical shock or short-circuits. Ensure
                that there are no water leaks around the toilet.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Child Safety:</h3>   
            <ul>
                <li>Smart toilets can have advanced features that may intrigue young children. Supervision is essential to prevent accidents
                and misuse.</li>
                <li>Educate children about the proper use of the smart toilet and discourage them from playing with its features.</li>
                <li>Consider using childproof locks or covers to restrict access when necessary, especially if your smart toilet has
                features like automatic flushing or bidet functions that may be tempting for children to use.</li>   
            </ul>      
            <br>
            <h3>3. UV Light and Lid Closure:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Some smart toilets use UV light for disinfection after use. UV light can be harmful to the eyes and skin, so it's
                important to keep the toilet lid closed when it's not in use.</li>
                <li>Closing the lid not only prevents exposure to UV light but also maintains cleanliness by preventing dust and debris from
                ente ring the bowl.</li>
                <li>After using the toilet, please ensure that the lid is closed because UV light is harmful to the Human body.</li>
            </ul> 
            <br>
            <h3>4. Cleaning and Maintenance:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly clean and maintain your smart toilet as per the manufacturer's guidelines. This typically involves using mild,
                non-abrasive cleaners to avoid damaging the toilet's surfaces and components.</li>
                <li>Follow the recommended maintenance schedule to keep the toilet in safe working condition. This may include checking for
                leaks, inspecting hoses and connections, and addressing any issues promptly to prevent further damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Correct Flush Button</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Smart toilets often come with multiple flush buttons or settings, such as a half-flush and a full-flush option for water
                conservation. Ensure you use the appropriate button for the desired flush volume.</li>
                <li>Using the wrong flush button may result in improper flushing, which could lead to clogs or other issues. Following the
                manufacturer's instructions for flush button usage is essential.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>6. Motion Sensor Box</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The motion sensor box is a sensitive component that detects user presence and activates various functions, such as
                automatic flushing or bidet features.</li>
                <li>Avoid tampering with the motion sensor box by moving your hand or palm inside it. This could disrupt the toilet's
                operation or potentially lead to unexpected flushing or unintended actions.</li>
            </ul>
